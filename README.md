# TinyTinkerLab

Welcome to **TinyTinkerLab**, a personal sandbox for small projects, experiments, and code snippets. This repository serves as a playground for trying out ideas that are too small for individual repositories.

## Projects

Each folder in this repository contains a tiny project or experiment, along with any relevant documentation. Feel free to explore and tinker around!

1. **[Patched Maze Generator](PatchedMazeGenerator/README.md)**
2. **[RNN Sinusoidal](RNNSinusoidal/README.md)**
